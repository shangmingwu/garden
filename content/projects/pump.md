I built a website for [Prospective Medical Professionals](https://www.pumprofessionals.org/), a charity connecting high-school students to opportunities in health and life sciences. We migrated from a WordPress site in order to build custom components and services, such as an opportunities portal served from a database.

We built reusable components with React and TypeScript and used Prisma ORM for the opportunities database. The site was built as a static site with Next.js.
