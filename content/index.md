Welcome to my digital garden.

I'm a computer science (and maybe math?) student at the University of Waterloo. Sometimes I [[posts/index|write]], and sometimes I [[projects/index|build]]. Currently, I'm studying math and computer science, learning to curl, and running the Effective Altruism Club. In January I'll be researching large language models in Huawei's Data and Privacy Protection Lab.

In the past, I represented Team Canada twice at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, and attended SPARC in 2022, and interned in Huawei's Distributed Data Storage and Management Lab.
