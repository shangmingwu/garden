# What am I doing now?

I'm currently:

- Studying computer science (and possibly also majoring in math) at the University of Waterloo.
  - This term (Fall 2023) I'm organizing the Effective Altruism Club on-campus.
- Building [[projects/index|random projects]] in my free time.
- Occasionally [[posts/index|writing]] when I have an idea.
- Becoming more active - I've started going to the gym with my friends, and I'm also learning to curl!

# Little interesting things

- I was born in Canada, and given the [[posts/nl|name]] Simon Wu at birth, but my parents later came up with the Chinese name 吴尚鸣 for me.
  - In Mandarin (普通话), which my parents speak at home, my name is pronounced *wú shàngmíng*.
  - In Cantonese (广东话), the native language of my father, my name is pronounced *ng4 soeng6 ming4*.
